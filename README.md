# Decentralized Medical History Management System

## Overview

The Decentralized Medical History Management System is a blockchain-based application designed to empower patients by giving them control over their medical records. The system functions as a decentralized wallet for medical history, enabling patients to store, manage, and share their health information securely with healthcare providers.

## Key Features

### Patient-Centric Control:

Patients own their medical records and have complete control over access.

Granular permissions allow patients to decide who can view or modify specific parts of their medical history.

### Doctor Access Management:

Patients can grant or revoke access to healthcare professionals.

Doctors can securely read and write medical records based on granted permissions.

### Decentralized Storage:

Medical data is stored on a blockchain, ensuring immutability, transparency, and security.

Reduces the risk of data breaches compared to centralized systems.

### Audit Trail:

Every access or modification is logged on the blockchain, providing a complete and tamper-proof audit trail.

### Interoperability:

Supports integration with existing healthcare systems and standards.

Ensures compatibility across multiple providers and regions.

## Technologies Used

### Blockchain: Provides the foundation for decentralization and security.

### Smart Contracts: Manage access permissions and execute rules for record sharing.

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): For storing larger medical documents and images securely off-chain.

### Cryptography: Ensures secure data access and sharing.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Node.js and npm installed.

A blockchain wallet (e.g., MetaMask) configured for the target network.

Access to a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, or a private blockchain).

## Steps

### Clone the repository:

##
    git clone https://github.com/username/decentralized-medical-history.git
cd decentralized-medical-history

### Install dependencies:

npm install

### Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.

### Define variables for blockchain network configuration and API keys.

### Deploy smart contracts:

npx hardhat deploy

### Start the application:

npm start

## How It Works

### For Patients

Register: Create an account and set up your decentralized wallet.

Upload Records: Add medical records to your wallet securely.

Grant Access: Share specific records with doctors by setting permissions.

### For Doctors

Request Access: Send an access request to the patient.

View/Edit Records: Depending on permissions, view or update medical history.

Maintain Records: Ensure data accuracy and add new records as needed.

## Security and Privacy

### Decentralized Architecture: Eliminates single points of failure.

### Permissioned Access: Ensures data privacy and compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

### Encryption: Secures sensitive medical data during storage and transmission.

## Roadmap

Add support for mobile applications.

Integrate AI for medical data analytics.

Expand compatibility with more healthcare standards (e.g., FHIR, HL7).

Implement multi-language support for global accessibility.
